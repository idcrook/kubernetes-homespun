## Static Config

Create and edit a file named `homepage-cm-secrets.yaml` starting from `homepage-cm.yaml`. 

This is so api keys can be stored since there is not currently a method to use envariables, etc. This is not intended to be commited to git, but it would be useful to version and backup the configuration. For example, can use local RCS.
